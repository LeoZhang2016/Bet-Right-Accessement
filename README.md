2.   use the selector to select the category which switch to different categories 
     and store the selected category value

3.   define the custom hook to realize the FetchAPI and store the race data 

  
4.   use the RaceCard function component to display the  race list 

5.   finally test the Category selector component and it function is  good for select change event
